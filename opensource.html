<h2 id="ESG" class="anchored">Economic Scenario Generator</h2>
<div class="text-justify">
  <p>Economics Scenarios Generation (ESG) models seek to coherently simulate economic indicators and returns for different assets classes across multiple time periods. For example, an economic scenario file may include 1000 scenarios of inflation and corporate bond returns over 50 years, with inflation and corporate bond returns properly integrated. These scenarios are then the basis for projecting future asset and liability positions. Insurers and asset managers place heavy reliance on simulated economic scenarios for risk and capital management purposes.</p>
  <p>This project targets at proposing and developing best-in-class multi-asset class ESG models in the U.S. and Singapore economies, taking into account their unique characteristics and practical limitations of local capital markets. In general there are two scenario “frameworks”: Risk Neutral (RN), and Real World (RW) scenarios. Risk Neutral (RN) scenarios are consis- tent with the theory underlying the Black-Scholes valuation and are more suited for a “point in time” valuation of options and guarantees (embedded in both assets and liabilities). Real World (RW) scenarios reflect the risk premium and may embed an investor’s own ‘world view’, with more structure built into how different assets evolve “realistically” over time, and are therefore more suited for longer term risk and capital projections.</p>
  <p>In this project, we aim to develop the ESG model nested in RN framework across several assets classes, as we employ arbitrage-free approach to model the term structure also for other assets. RN approaches are preferable to the RW ones, because they are based on arbitrage free assumptions and market consistent. Although there are some limitations as we discussed above, this framework should be developed for handling these limitations and identifying the potential weaknesses of the calibrated models. The end product will be reviewed and considered when constructing our optimization engine for strategic and tactical asset allocation.</p>
