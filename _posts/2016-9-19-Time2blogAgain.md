Well, it has been more than 7 months that I have not updated my own website. I have been busy working with the stuff on my hand at [Rayliant Global Advisors](http://www.rayliantadvisors.com/).

The work at Rayliant is great. Building the whole platform from scratch is much harder than I expected, but it is too much fun in finishing the tasks. But alongside, I still believe making something `interesting` by myself would be valuable. So here is what I would like to do.

About 10 months ago, right before my graudation from Anderson[http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/], some of my colleagues worked on a project involving the follwing paper: [Principal Components as a Measure of Systemic Risk](https://www.iinews.com/site/pdfs/JPM_Summer2011_StateStreet.pdf). In their final presentation, this method works incredibly well in the U.S. market. PCA can be assessed as a measure of systematic risk, thus provide us the information when to hold more equity and when to hold more cash.

This is a very interesting result. Since I am now working on China's A-share market, I am wondering whether this method would also work in the a market that is not as efficient as U.S.
